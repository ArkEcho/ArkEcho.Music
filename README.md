### Description
This is a private, non-commercial Project, developed by ArkEcho.

You just want to spontaneously Listen to your favorite Song. Streaming Services don't provide it, but it exists in your Private Collection.
The last Time you synced your Collection was two Months ago. We all know, how hard it is, to keep its Music Library Up-to-Date, on multiple Devices.

But wait! There is a Solution, it's ArkEcho Server and App.
The ArkEcho Server provides a BackEnd for Syncing your Music as well as a WebPage with an integrated Player.
ArkEcho App is a normal Music Player App, that automatically syncs your Music Library to your Android Phone.
