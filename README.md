### Description
This is a private, non-commercial Project, developed by ArkEcho.

You just want to spontaneously Listen to your favorite Song?
Streaming Services don't provide it, but it exists in your Private Collection?
The last Time you synced your Collection was two Months ago?

But wait! There is a Solution - it's ArkEcho.Music!

We all know, how hard it is, to keep its Music Library Up-to-Date, on multiple Devices.
The ArkEcho Server provides a BackEnd for Syncing your Music as well as a WebPage with an integrated Player.
ArkEcho Maui is a Music Player App for Windows Desktop and Android Devices,
that automatically syncs your Music Library.
